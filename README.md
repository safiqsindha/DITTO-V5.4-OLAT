# DITTO V5.4 — OLAT (One Lever At A Time)

Pre-registered experimental study measuring how 24 prompting/inference levers ("Levers")
affect a model's ability to detect rule violations in Pokémon battle chains.

**SPEC hash (locked, Amendment #6):** `dbae94dba3ee39d67b131639ae626b1afa7f14645008d37aa0bb464e91980fc8`
**Models evaluated:** DeepSeek V4-Flash, V4-Pro
**Scale:** 3,200 API evaluations (64 conditions × 50 chains, dual-model)

## Study design

Each model is evaluated on 50 chains (sampled with `seed=42` from a pool of 19,428).
For each of 24 Levers, one or more levels (L1–L5) is run against the same chain set.
Ground truth is assessed under three universes:

| Universe | Definition | Intact/Violated split (n=50) |
|---|---|---|
| **L1** (shuffled-vs-real) | Was the chain shuffled? | 16 / 34 |
| **L2** (planted violations) | Does the chain contain a planted rule violation? | 16 / 34 |
| **L3** (symbolic checker) | Does a symbolic rule checker flag a violation? | 18 / 32 |

For this 50-chain draw, L1 and L2 are identical (every chain labeled violated in L1 is
also labeled violated in L2), so effective independent universes = 2.

Detection rate `dr = P(YES | chain)`. Gap convention (Convention B):
```
gap = dr_violated − dr_intact          (TPR − FPR, both inside the condition)
effect_size = gap(condition) − gap(baseline)
```

Classification thresholds:

| |effect_size| | Label |
|---|---|
| ≥ 0.10 | Meaningful |
| 0.03–0.10 | Directional |
| < 0.03 | Null |

If the 95% BCa bootstrap CI crosses zero, the label is downgraded one level.

## Methodology

- **Parser:** 4-stage cascade on the model's `content` field (strict → permissive → md_strip → last_token). `reasoning_content` is preserved but never parsed (SPEC §8, Amendment #3).
- **Bootstrap:** BCa with 10,000 iterations and jackknife acceleration. Seeds: 42 (Flash), 43 (Pro).
- **Six sensitivity analyses per condition (SPEC §9.2):** S1 unparseables-as-NO; S2 unparseables-as-random; S3 arcsine-transformed gap; S4 parser-strict subset; S5 parse-failure audit (≥10% flagged); S6 response-length quartile (L18 L2/L3 only, now token-based — see Day 2 quartile analysis).
- **Robustness flags:** `robustness_concern` if Meaningful primary + ≥3/6 sensitivities Null; `hidden_signal_candidate` if Null primary + ≥3/6 sensitivities Meaningful.
- **Empirical Bayes shrinkage:** prior mean = 0, prior variance = median observed bootstrap variance across levers.

## Headline findings (Universe L3, primary)

**6 Meaningful conditions** (effect ≥ 0.10, CI excludes zero):

| Condition | Effect | CI | Universes Meaningful in |
|---|---|---|---|
| pro_L17_L2 | 0.288 | [0.051, 0.486] | All 3 (most robust) |
| pro_L17_L3 | 0.243 | [0.010, 0.510] | All 3 (CI boundary-sensitive) |
| pro_L18_L3 | 0.354 | [0.026, 0.685] | All 3 |
| pro_L18_L2 | 0.379 | [0.036, 0.745] | L3 only |
| flash_L18_L2 | 0.217 | [0.026, 0.500] | L3 only |
| pro_L12_L3 | 0.191 | [0.017, 0.438] | L3 only |

**Reasoning-depth threshold effect** (token-quartile analysis, supersedes Day 2 S6 character-length):
Both V4 models exhibit a *valley-then-peak* pattern on L18 L3. At intermediate response lengths,
partial chain-of-thought produces **worse-than-baseline** results — intact chains over-trigger YES
relative to violated chains.

- **V4-Pro** valley: 427–487 tokens (effect ≈ −0.36, CI [−0.78, −0.06]); escape at ~494 tokens.
- **V4-Flash** valley: 606–728 tokens (effect ≈ −0.14, CI touches 0); escape at ~729 tokens.

This is a Mew design constraint: configurations that cap CoT generation inside the valley range
will yield worse-than-baseline behavior on rule-violation detection.

## Amendment #7 — L18 L4 (Native Thinking) retest

The original L18 L4 run (`max_tokens=64`) produced 100/100 `Unknown`. Root cause: DeepSeek's
API applies `max_tokens` to total output (`reasoning_content` + `content`), not content-only
as the SPEC assumed. The 64-token budget was entirely consumed by reasoning before any verdict
could be emitted.

**Amendment #7** retested L18 L4 at `max_tokens=4096` (other parameters unchanged). The full
retest is complete (100 calls; cost ~$4.10).

**Headline:** L18 L4 classifies as **Null in all 3 universes for both models**, with
`dr_violated = dr_intact = 1.0` on parseable records. **73/73 parseable verdicts are YES, 0
are NO** — a model YES-bias under native thinking, not a detection capability. 27% of
records truncated at 4096 tokens (Flash 24%, Pro 30%); intact chains truncate at 33% vs.
19–28% on violated, hinting at asymmetric reasoning cost.

The retest output is written to `pre-registration/amendment_7/` as a *parallel product* — not
merged into primary effect tables without both-author signoff. See
[`pre-registration/amendment_7/summary.md`](pre-registration/amendment_7/summary.md) for the
effect tables and [`pre-registration/amendment_7/truncation_breakdown.md`](pre-registration/amendment_7/truncation_breakdown.md)
for the truncation diagnostic. Methodology amendment doc:
[`pre-registration/amendments/amendment_7.md`](pre-registration/amendments/amendment_7.md).

## Reproducing the analysis

```bash
# Requires DEEPSEEK_API_KEY in ../.env (path resolved by scripts at runtime)
python3 pre-registration/scripts/day1_executor.py --dry-run    # pre-flight + cost estimate
python3 pre-registration/scripts/day1_executor.py              # full Day 1 run
python3 pre-registration/scripts/day2_analysis.py              # rebuild Day 2 effect tables
python3 pre-registration/scripts/quartile_analysis.py          # token-quartile breakdown
```

All scripts are append-only with resume support (`parser_provenance.ndjson` keyed by
`(condition_id, sample_id)`).

## Pre-registration provenance

This study was pre-registered before any data collection. The SPEC has been locked since
Amendment #6 (hash `dbae94d…`). All deviations from the locked SPEC are recorded in
`pre-registration/amendments/`. The Amendment #7 retest is the only post-Day-1 methodology
change; all other Day 2 outputs use the original locked SPEC.
